# 🔍 Real-Time Object Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates a **real-time object detection system built using OpenCV and Python**.  
The detector processes live video input, identifies objects, and draws bounding boxes with labels in real time.

The goal of this project is to showcase the fundamentals of **computer vision**, **image processing**, and **object detection** using OpenCV.

## 📌 Features
- Real-time object detection using webcam / video feed  
- Bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects  
- Fast and efficient frame processing  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to extend  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Capture frames from a live video stream  
2. Preprocess each frame for detection  
3. Apply object detection logic  
4. Draw bounding boxes and labels  
5. Display the output in real time
